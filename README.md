# habs2nodcNetCDF
A tool for generating NODC-compliant NetCDF file with observation data

#Requirements:
1. NetCDF C library 4.X;
2. Python 2.7.X with psycopg2
3. lua 5.X
4. bash

Data processing and massaging are supposed to be straightforward tasks. However, There are couple challenges:

1. Both data and metadata need to be standardized;
2. Usually data and metadata are managed and maintained by different team member;
3. Data analyst is usually familiar with script language, such as python and feel comfortable to work with database through scripting;
4. Data couriers, on the other hand, may or may not have programming experience. However, they are OK to work with certain data format, such as XML;

These challenges inspire us to create a package that can be used by memebers in the team collaboratively:

1. Data people are responsible to script the routine to pull data from whatever source using python;
2. Metadata people are responsible to edit the metadata record for each observation platform using lua table;
3. A C script was written to make sure combining the outcomes from step 1 and 2 together into a valid file in NetCDF format;
4. Bash script is on top to automate the whole process and the final product will be a compressed dataset for a platform and its md5sum;

#Installation:

Simply copy files, put them in a folder, then

make

This should compile C script for you. Make sure you have libnetcdf and liblua available on the machine.

The last step will be store the folder's absolute name on the first line of commom.lua


#Preparation:

In order to have a valid NODC submittal, browse all global metadata attributes inside common.lua.

#Usage:

In order to link a platform with this tool. Two files are necessary, a lua file is needed in platform-config/platform_name folder to specifiy the specific
metadata attributes. This also includes the location for C script to retrieve the data file for a measurement.

Then a python script file is needed in platform/platform_name folder for retrieving observation data from a data source. For our case here, the data store is 
a PostgreSQL database.
